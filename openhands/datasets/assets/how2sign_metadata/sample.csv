-d5dN54tH2E_0-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_0-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|We're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you.
-d5dN54tH2E_1-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_1-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|I call it painting the wall.
-d5dN54tH2E_10-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_10-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands, down and up; down and up.
-d5dN54tH2E_11-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_11-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And just let those fingers relax.
-d5dN54tH2E_12-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_12-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Now together you're going to go opposite.
-d5dN54tH2E_13-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_13-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable.
-d5dN54tH2E_14-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_14-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead, so try not to let them do that.
-d5dN54tH2E_15-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_15-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Let the wrist do all the leading.
-d5dN54tH2E_2-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_2-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So this one what you're going to start with, let's take one hand first; it's going to, the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up.
-d5dN54tH2E_3-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_3-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement, and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going.
-d5dN54tH2E_4-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_4-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Don't let the fingers take over, let the wrist do all the guiding.
-d5dN54tH2E_5-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_5-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft.
-d5dN54tH2E_6-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_6-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted, and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed.
-d5dN54tH2E_7-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_7-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So let's start with the one hand going up and down.
-d5dN54tH2E_8-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_8-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|We're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself.
-d5dN54tH2E_9-1-rgb_front|sample/-d5dN54tH2E_9-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You want it right in front of your solar plexus.
-f1_kdl050s_0-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_0-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|In this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise.
-f1_kdl050s_1-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_1-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|The number one loss for these birds, is flight.
-f1_kdl050s_10-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_10-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted.
-f1_kdl050s_11-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_11-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It seems to be the number one way to loose them.
-f1_kdl050s_12-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_12-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Once they get loose outside, predators will get to them very quickly.
-f1_kdl050s_13-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_13-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|These guys are not suited to live in the United States, they are not native here and they don't survive.
-f1_kdl050s_14-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_14-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|The other dangers you need to worry about, is Teflon pans.
-f1_kdl050s_15-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_15-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|If they are heated to a high temperature, they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead.
-f1_kdl050s_16-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_16-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|There is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly.
-f1_kdl050s_17-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_17-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It is kind of a silent killer.
-f1_kdl050s_18-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_18-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So, if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with Teflon, move them to another room in the house, so that you can protect them.
-f1_kdl050s_19-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_19-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Aerosols, spraying for bugs, spraying perfumes around the house, all those sort of things, these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs.
-f1_kdl050s_2-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_2-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|If these guys are flighted, you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household.
-f1_kdl050s_20-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_20-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And, these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die.
-f1_kdl050s_21-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_21-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house.
-f1_kdl050s_22-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_22-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And lastly, they are so so tiny, basically anything in your house, a dog, a cat, anything, they can get squished in a door, if they get mouthed, even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat, or by your kid, they will just squished.
-f1_kdl050s_23-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_23-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|There is not a whole lot to them, they are not that robust, they are mostly feathers.
-f1_kdl050s_24-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_24-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You have to be fairly careful with these birds.
-f1_kdl050s_25-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_25-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|At least in a physical way.
-f1_kdl050s_26-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_26-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Those are most of your household dangers.
-f1_kdl050s_27-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_27-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And again, if you are cooking and the birds are loose, be careful with them landing on a hot pan.
-f1_kdl050s_28-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_28-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned.
-f1_kdl050s_29-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_29-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Just be careful, you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage, you basically bombproof your house.
-f1_kdl050s_3-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_3-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|A lot of these birds aren't tame.
-f1_kdl050s_30-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_30-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for.
-f1_kdl050s_31-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_31-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And, if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage, they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars.
-f1_kdl050s_32-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_32-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird.
-f1_kdl050s_33-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_33-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And, if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine, raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys.
-f1_kdl050s_34-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_34-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time.
-f1_kdl050s_35-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_35-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|That more or less covers it, just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are.
-f1_kdl050s_4-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_4-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|People get them and they only have two or three of them.
-f1_kdl050s_5-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_5-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|As you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away.
-f1_kdl050s_6-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_6-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And when they panic, they fly and they don't come back.
-f1_kdl050s_7-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_7-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|They fly out your windows.
-f1_kdl050s_8-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_8-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|They fly out your front door.
-f1_kdl050s_9-1-rgb_front|sample/-f1_kdl050s_9-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter, son, husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out.
00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|I hope this becomes very popular, here of late, is the circle hooks. Now, circle hooks has been used by Japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years, but in recent years, they've developed lighter, smaller, in shore type hooks, which are very well suited, particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing.
00dWJ4YRRSI_2-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_2-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|This hook, basically is designed, to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth.
00dWJ4YRRSI_3-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_3-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Now this type of hook, when you get a bite, you can't jerk the rod to set the hook.
00dWJ4YRRSI_4-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_4-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You basically just reel down, and get the line tight, and the fish will take off, and when he does, he usually turns, and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth, and it sort of acts, really like a, kind of like a bottle opener.
00dWJ4YRRSI_5-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_5-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Once you get it in there, it is very difficult to remove this hook, so if you catch a lot of fish, when you hook up the fish, you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism.
00dWJ4YRRSI_6-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_6-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|The nice thing about the circle hook is, you don't gut hook a lot of fish.
00dWJ4YRRSI_7-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_7-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You don't damage a lot of fish.
00dWJ4YRRSI_8-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_8-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|You simply get him up to the boat.
00dWJ4YRRSI_9-1-rgb_front|sample/00dWJ4YRRSI_9-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|If you want to release him, you can release him, or cut the hook out, and it's a pretty, it's a pretty friendly hook, for fishing.
0oGfy530AuI_0-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_0-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|MICHAEL ROSENGART: Thrusters.
0oGfy530AuI_1-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_1-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Right now, we're going to get into a more complicated exercise.
0oGfy530AuI_10-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_10-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Jonesy is going to sit back.
0oGfy530AuI_11-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_11-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And as he drives up, again, driving on his heel, driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up.
0oGfy530AuI_12-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_12-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Good.
0oGfy530AuI_13-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_13-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders.
0oGfy530AuI_14-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_14-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Not out to the side, not back, but right above.
0oGfy530AuI_15-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_15-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|That's good.
0oGfy530AuI_16-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_16-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Good work, Jonesy.
0oGfy530AuI_17-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_17-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Again working from the heels up, work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time, good work.
0oGfy530AuI_18-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_18-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break, and then come back to it.
0oGfy530AuI_19-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_19-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Again, I want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up, and it is one smooth movement.
0oGfy530AuI_2-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_2-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|We're integrating more of the body.
0oGfy530AuI_20-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_20-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It's not segmented.
0oGfy530AuI_21-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_21-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It's not the squat and a shoulder press, okay?
0oGfy530AuI_22-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_22-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It's one smooth movement.
0oGfy530AuI_23-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_23-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Try it.
0oGfy530AuI_3-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_3-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion.
0oGfy530AuI_4-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_4-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Okay.
0oGfy530AuI_5-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_5-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So, Jonesy, you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is?
0oGfy530AuI_6-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_6-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells, bring it up to his shoulders.
0oGfy530AuI_7-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_7-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And we're, basically, he's going to sit back into a squat.
0oGfy530AuI_8-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_8-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|And we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press, but it's not that simple.
0oGfy530AuI_9-1-rgb_front|sample/0oGfy530AuI_9-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|It's not segmented like that.
0pKzG0RRUz4_0-1-rgb_front|sample/0pKzG0RRUz4_0-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end.

0pKzG0RRUz4_1-1-rgb_front|sample/0pKzG0RRUz4_1-1-rgb_front.mp4|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|So no matter what the length of your hair, long as it's long enough to add a, at the hair on, we can start by braiding it on, then braid, then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like, whatever size you like, whatever color you like.
